# License Manager UI

## What is this Project about
License Manager is a simple UI for the [Standard Licensing](https://github.com/junian/Standard.Licensing) Repo from Junian.
You can simply generate Licenses from a simple UI, and the Licenses will be saved in a xml file in defined Folder named by the customer and the expiration Date.

## Status
The main functionality is working but there are still some things to do. See the Issues to contribute and bring the project further. Also the code is still quick and dirty,
because I had to write that while working on another Project, which I had to use this for.

## Who can use this
Developers who do implement [Standard Licensing](https://github.com/junian/Standard.Licensing)
to validate Licenses in their application.
